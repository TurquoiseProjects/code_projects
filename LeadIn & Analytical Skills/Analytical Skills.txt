Google is a good example for excellent usability.  The reason for this is the simple interface which has led to common use.  When people say they will search for something, they say they will, "google it".  Google has developed complicated algorithms for the backend search function, and is dependant on websites adding in the correct search keys.  However, the user is not aware of this because all they need to do is enter their search terms into a single textbox.  Google even supports misspelled words and is able to "guess" the correct search term.  This further enhances the simplification from the user, because they don't need to consider what keys a website might register.  Most users are not aware how the search operates, because they do not need to think in order to use it.  This total simplification is why it is one of the top examples for excellent usability.
